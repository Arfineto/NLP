# Sentiment Polarization

This project was made to allow the classification of sentences into either positive or negative.

## Getting Started

This notebook contains different functions to simplify some NLP tasks like the cleaning of the data and the vectorization of the data thanks to a Word2Vec model.

The classification is made thanks to a Neural Network built with Keras.

To use the code provided here, you'll need some datasets with positive or negative labelled sentences.

### Prerequisites

To run this code, you'll need the following python librairies :

* Numpy
* Gensim
* Nltk
* Sklearn
* Keras

###Â Datasets

For this work, I used different datasets gathered online. You can find them here :
* [Sentiment Labelled Sentences Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences)
* [Movie review Data Set](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/)
* [Books and Movies review](https://www.kaggle.com/c/si650winter11/data)
